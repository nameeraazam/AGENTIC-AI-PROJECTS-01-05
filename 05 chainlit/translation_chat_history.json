(e.g., a college application, a job application, a personal blog)  This will greatly influence the tone and content.\n* **The desired length:**  A short essay will have a different structure than a longer one.\n* **Specific topics to include:**  What are your most defining characteristics, experiences, or goals?  (e.g., your personality, your ambitions, a significant life event)\n* **The overall tone:** Do you want it to be formal or informal?  Serious or humorous?\n\n\nOnce I have this information, I can help you craft a compelling and insightful essay about yourself.\n"
